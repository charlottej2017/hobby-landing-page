    <p>
      Cozy game is a video game genre that emphasizes non-violence and
      relaxation. Initially derived from the life simulation genre, cozy games
      commonly include activities such as gathering and growing plants and
      nurturing other characters. They often have open-ended goals that
      encourage self-expression. While developers have suggested the style may
      have appeared in games as early as Little Computer People (1985) and The
      Sims (2000), it became a more common term following the release of Animal
      Crossing: New Horizons (2020), with dozens of games using it as part of
      their marketing.
